It is *highly* recommended to subscribe to PhpWebGallery newsletter. This is
extremely low-traffic, but will provide you with announcements of new
PhpWebGallery releases and serious bug notification. You can subscribe at
this URL :

         http://www.phpwebgallery.net/eng/index.php?rub=newsletter

Being myself very disturbed because of spam, be sure that the mail address
you are going to give for newsletter is completely unreadable by someone
else than PhpWebGallery team and not present on any web page (a web search
engine won't find it).

PhpWebGallery also assure you that your mail address will NEVER be used for
something else than PhpWebGallery newsletter.
