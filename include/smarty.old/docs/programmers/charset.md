Charset Encoding {#charset.encoding}
================

There are a variety of encodings for textual data, ISO-8859-1 (Latin1)
and UTF-8 being the most popular. Unless specified otherwise with the
`SMARTY_RESOURCE_CHAR_SET` constant, Smarty recognizes `UTF-8` as the
internal charset if [Multibyte String](https://www.php.net/mbstring) is
available, `ISO-8859-1` if not.

> **Note**
>
> `ISO-8859-1` has been PHP\'s default internal charset since the
> beginning. Unicode has been evolving since 1991. Since then it has
> become the one charset to conquer them all, as it is capable of
> encoding most of the known characters even accross different character
> systems (latin, cyrillic, japanese, ...). `UTF-8` is unicode\'s most
> used encoding, as it allows referencing the thousands of character
> with the smallest size overhead possible.
>
> Since unicode and UTF-8 are very wide spread nowadays, their use is
> strongly encouraged.

> **Note**
>
> Smarty\'s internals and core plugins are truly UTF-8 compatible since
> Smarty 3.1. To achieve unicode compatibility, the [Multibyte
> String](https://www.php.net/mbstring) PECL is required. Unless your PHP
> environment offers this package, Smarty will not be able to offer
> full-scale UTF-8 compatibility.
