\$template\_dir {#variable.template.dir}
===============

This is the name of the default template directory. If you do not supply
a resource type when including files, they will be found here. By
default this is `./templates`, meaning that Smarty will look for the
`templates/` directory in the same directory as the executing php
script. \$template\_dir can also be an array of directory paths: Smarty
will traverse the directories and stop on the first matching template
found.
