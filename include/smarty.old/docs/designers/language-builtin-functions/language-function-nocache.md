{nocache} {#language.function.nocache}
=========

`{nocache}` is used to disable caching of a template section. Every
`{nocache}` must be paired with a matching `{/nocache}`.

> **Note**
>
> Be sure any variables used within a non-cached section are also
> assigned from PHP when the page is loaded from the cache.



    Today's date is
    {nocache}
    {$smarty.now|date_format}
    {/nocache}

       

The above code will output the current date on a cached page.

See also the [caching section](#caching).
