It is *highly* recommended to subscribe to PhpWebGallery newsletter. This is
extremely low-traffic, but will provide you with announcements of new
PhpWebGallery releases and serious bug notification. You will find available
mailing lists at this URL :

                 https://gna.org/mail/?group=phpwebgallery

Be sure that the mail address you are going to give for newsletter is
completely unreadable by someone else than PhpWebGallery team and not
present on any web page (a web search engine won't find it).

PhpWebGallery also assure you that your mail address will NEVER be used for
something else than PhpWebGallery informations.

A forum is available and recommended for any question (installation, bug
reports, new feature requests) :

                     http://forum.phpwebgallery.net

Before asking any question on the forum, do not hesitate to search for
related topics... other users may have found same bugs, had same requests.

PhpWebGallery forum is a place open to every one. Please be always
respectful in this place. Consider also that clear messages (with simple and
direct subjects) are always prefered. It is forbidden (and useless) to say
that your question is "urgent", you won't be answered in priority.
