	* new : introduction page to administration section. This page
	gives informations about PhpWebGallery version, PHP version, MySQL
	version, gallery database informations (number of categories,
	elements, users, comments). Ability to request phpwebgallery.net
	for upgrade.

	* deletion : of obsolete admin/admin_phpinfo.php page replaced by
	a link in introduction page.

2005-08-14 Pierrick LE GALL

	screen to manage categories properties (admin/cat_options)

2005-08-14 Pierrick LE GALL

2005-08-14 Pierrick LE GALL

	* new : maintenance screen in administration. There you can update
	categories informations (number of images, date of the last added
	element), update images informations (path, average rate), purge
	obsolete sessions, purge history.

	* new : ability to have random representative for categories. This
	configuration parameter is set to false by default.

	* new : ability to set an element as representative of a category
	without belonging to the category. Thus, administrator can choose
	representative even for empty categories.

	* improvement : semantically superior design for category edition
	screen by regrouping fields in fieldsets. The improved screen
	contains action buttons as in category list screen.

	* new : ability to move a virtual category (ie change its parent
	category).

	* bug fixed : the sync_users function checks all user children
	tables (access, cache, group association).

2005-08-08 Pierrick LE GALL

	* new : external authentication in another users table. Previous
	users table is divided between users (common properties with any
	web application) and user_infos (phpwebgallery specific
	informations). External table and fields can be configured.
	
	* modification : profile.php is not reachable through
	administration anymore (not useful).

	* modification : in profile.php, current password is mandatory
	only if user tries to change his password. Username can't be
	changed.

	* deletion : of obsolete functions get_user_restrictions,
	update_user_restrictions, get_user_all_restrictions,
	is_user_allowed, update_user

	* modification : $user['forbidden_categories'] equals at least
	"-1" so that category_id NOT IN ($user['forbidden_categories'])
	can always be used.

	* modification : user_forbidden table becomes user_cache so that
	not only restriction informations can be stored in this table.

	* improvement : in admin/element_set_global, javascript is not
	used anymore to select an item with its thumbnail

2005-07-17 Pierrick LE GALL

	* bug fixed : in admin/user_list, if target is "selection" and
	that no user is selected, an error occurs

2005-07-17 Pierrick LE GALL

	* new feature : use Apache authentication. If
	$conf['apache_authentication'] is set true : if no user matches
	$_SERVER['REMOTE_USER'] in "users" table, PWG automatically
	creates one. This way, users can customize the behaviour of the
	application.

	* template : new organisation of identification menu
	(category.php). Simplification is required for Apache
	authentication (no logout link even if user is externally logged
	in)

	* new : usernames can contain quotes (required because Apache
	authentication authorized quotes in usernames)

2005-07-17 Pierrick LE GALL

	* new configuration parameter : hide thumbnail captions on main
	page with $conf['show_thumbnail_caption']

	external tool (FeedCreator class v1.7.2). New file feed.php

	* new database field : comments.validation_date (datetime). This
	field is required for notification feed.

	* new database field : users.feed_id (varchar(50)). users.feed_id
	is an alias of users.id but is much more complicated to find (50
	characters, figures or letters, case sensitive) : the purpose is
	to keep it secret (as far as possible).

	* new database field : users.last_feed_check (datetime)

	* new database field : users.registration_date (datetime)

	* bug fixed : no need to add the (unavailable) session id to
	install.php in the installation form.

	* modified database field : images.date_available become more
	precise (date to datetime). This precision is needed for
	notification feed.

	* new index : comments_i1 (validation_date). Might be useful for
	feed queries.

	* new index : comments_i2 (image_id). Useful each time you want to
	have informations about an element and its associated comments.

	* version 9.11 of mysqldump outputs database field names and table
	names with backquote "`" (didn't find how to take them off)
	
2005-06-30 Pierrick LE GALL
	
	* category permissions management comes back! (it disappeared in
	branch 1.4) This time, it is designed to support better long users

	include/config_default.inc.php)

	* direct communication between templates and language items,
	without needing a mapping in the PHP code.

2005-06-21 Pierrick LE GALL

	* new function get_name_from_file to centralize the construction
	of displayed name from the filename

	* new function l10n which returns the corresponding value from
	$lang if existing. Else, the key is returned. This means that if a
	language item is not translated, the key is displayed instead
	(better than nothing).

2005-06-11 Pierrick LE GALL

	* errors and informations boxes : management centralized in
	admin.php, $errors and $infos arrays replaced by $page['errors']
	and $page['infos'], special management for admin/update.php (more
	complex management)

	* user list updated : ability to filter list on group

2005-04-25 Pierrick LE GALL

	* include/config.inc.php becomes include/config_default.inc.php :

	include/config_local.inc.php can be used for overwriting
	configuration parameters
	
2005-04-25 Pierrick LE GALL

	* come back to previous version of include/constants.php :

2005-04-16 Pierrick LE GALL <pierrick /at/ phpwebgallery {dot} net>

	* elements batch management : element_set page becomes the
	frontend to element_set_global and element_set_unit, infos_images
	(after a long time of use) become deprecated : the more powerful
	element_set is used instead. Consequently, batch management
	concerns caddie but also "normal categories".
	
	* refactoring code in admin.php to include the sub-file (clearer)

	* caddie : function fill_caddie replaces the code in category.php
	and can be used in admin/element_set.php

	* caddie : caddie table is added in delete_elements function

2005-04-16 Pierrick LE GALL <pierrick /at/ phpwebgallery {dot} net>

	* elements batch management : in addition to global mode, a unit
	mode is added : ability to manage a set of elements, element by
	element. This screen is very close to the existing "infos_images"
	(which will soon disappear).

	* elements batch management : in screen element_set_global, the
	display options are displayed at the top as in element_set_unit
	
2005-04-11 Pierrick LE GALL <pierrick /at/ phpwebgallery {dot} net>

	* functions get_day_list and get_month_list moved from search.php
	to include/functions.inc.php : these functions are now also used
	in admin/element_set_global.php

	of elements to display per line, ability to set {author, name,

	category and element that already exists

	* logical separation of category name under thumbnail and element
	name

2005-03-25 Pierrick LE GALL <pierrick at phpwebgallery dot net>

	* application version is defined at build or release
	creation. This way, include/constants.php won't change at each
	build.

2005-03-25 Pierrick LE GALL <pierrick at phpwebgallery dot net>

	* typo fixed : wrong block name closed in template

2005-03-25 Pierrick LE GALL <pierrick at phpwebgallery dot net>
