<legend>Permissions on albums</legend>

<p>If privacy levels do not fit your needs, you can also manage permissions on albums for a user or a group. You can manage permissions on photos and albums at the same time, without conflict.</p>

<p>You can forbid access to albums. Switch the album access type to
"private" if you want to manage permissions.</p>

<p>You can set a album to private by editing a single album
(<span class="pwgScreen">Administration &raquo; Albums &raquo; Manage
&raquo; edit</span>) or by setting options to your whole album tree
(<span class="pwgScreen">Administration &raquo; Albums &raquo;
Properties &raquo; Public / Private</span>).</p>

<p>Once the album is private, you can manage permissions for groups and
users with 3 screens:</p>

<ul>

  <li><span class="pwgScreen">Administration &raquo; Users &raquo; Manage &raquo;
  permissions action</span> (one link per user)</li>

  <li><span class="pwgScreen">Administration &raquo; Users &raquo; Groups &raquo;
  permissions action</span> (one link per group)</li>

  <li><span class="pwgScreen">Administration &raquo; Albums &raquo; Manage &raquo; edit
  album permissions action</span> (one link per album)</li>

</ul>

<legend>Permissions on photos</legend>

<p>Each photo has a <strong>privacy level</strong> (a lock). Each user also has a privacy level (a key). There are 5 privacy levels:</p>
<ol>
  <li>None</li>
  <li><em>Contacts</em></li>
  <li><em>Friends (which is higher than a contact)</em></li>
  <li><em>Family (which is higher than a friend)</em></li>
  <li><em>Admins (which is higher than any other level)</em></li>
</ol>

<p>Higher levels have permissions on lower levels. For a given user, the higher the privacy level, the more photos he can see.</p>

<p>For example, if photo "peter_wedding-0024.jpg" has <em>"Family"</em> privacy level, then:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Peter (who is an <em>"Admin"</em>) will see the photo because <em>"Admins"</em> can see all photos</li>
  <li>Beth (who is a <em>"Family"</em> member) will also see the photo</li>
  <li>Mary (who is just a <em>"Friend"</em>) won't see the photo</li>
</ul>

<p>A user that has no permission to see the content of a album won't see the album itself, not even its title. The same principle applies to a tag.</p>

<p>You can set the privacy level of a user on <span class="pwgScreen">Administration &raquo; Users &raquo; Manage</span> screen.</p>
