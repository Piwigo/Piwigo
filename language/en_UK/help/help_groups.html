<p>Groups are a convenient way to set permissions for a list of users.</p>

<p>Create groups in <span class="pwgScreen">Administration &raquo; Users
&raquo; Groups</span> and associate users to this group
in <span class="pwgScreen">Administration &raquo; Users &raquo;
Manage</span>.</p>

<p>A user can belong to several groups. Authorization takes precedence over
interdiction : if user "jack" belongs to groups "family" and "friends", and
that only group "family" can see album "Christmas 2010" album then
"jack" will be able to see "Christmas 2010".</p>
