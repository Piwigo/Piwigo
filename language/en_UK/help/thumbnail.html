  installed on your server. You will be warned by an error message, should you choose the wrong one; just come back to the previous page with your browser and choose the other version. If no
  version works, then  your server does not support GD.</dd>

  <dt>Width and height</dt>

  <dd>Maximum thumbnails dimensions. Original aspect ratio is
  preserved. Default values can be modified using configuration settings <code>tn_width</code> and
<code>tn_height</code> (see <span
class="filename">include/config_default.inc.php</span> file).</dd>

  <dt>Number of thumbnails to create</dt>

  <dd>Do not try to miniaturize too many photos at once. The miniaturization process does use a lot of CPU. If your Piwigo gallery is hosted by a free provider, too high CPU a load might lead to the withdrawal of your website.</dd>

  <dd>Thumbnails are created in JPEG file format. They
  can be created from PNG and JPEG photos only.</dd>
