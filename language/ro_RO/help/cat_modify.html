<h3>Representant</h3>

<p>The album representative is the thumbnail displayed on the main page (<span class="pwgScreen">category.php</span>) to represent
the album when
it contains only sub-albums and no direct photo (just as the root album).</p>
photo of a album :</p>

<ul>

  <li><span class="pwgScreen">Photo page</span>: one of the action buttons let you set the current photo as the representative for the
  displayed album. This button is available only for administrators.</li>

  <li><span class="pwgScreen">Modify informations about a photo</span> in
  administration. This screen can be reached from <span
  class="pwgScreen">picture.php</span> or <span class="pwgScreen">Batch
  management</span> in <em>unit mode</em>. See the help of this screen for
  details.</li>

  <li><span class="pwgScreen">Administration &raquo; Albums &raquo; Properties,
  Representative</span>. See the help of this screen for details.</li>

  <li><span class="pwgScreen">Edit album</span> (the present screen).</li>

</ul>

<p>The choice of a representative depends on the 
<code>allow_random_representative</code> configuration parameter (see <span
class="filename">include/config_default.inc.php</span>).</p>

<p>In default mode (<code>allow_random_representative</code> set to false),
each album containing at least one element is represented by a fixed
element. Once set (at album creation), the representative changes only
when an administrator ask for it. If the representative is not appropriate,
you can ask to <strong>Find a new representant by random</strong>.</p>

<p>If the <code>allow_random_representative</code> configuration parameter is
set to true, a category containing photos may have no fixed
representant. Just use <strong>Delete representant</strong> button.</p>

<p>If the album contains only sub-albums and no photo, it can nonetheless be represented by any element thanks to <span class="pwgScreen">Modify
informations about a photo</span> screen. The only option on the current screen
is the <strong>Delete representant</strong> button.</p>
