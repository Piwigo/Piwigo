<h2>Remote site</h2>

<p>PhpWebGallery offers the possibility to use several servers to store the
images which will compose your gallery. It can be useful if your gallery is
installed on one limited space and that you have a big quantity of images to
be shown.</p>

<ol>

  <li>edit file <span class="filename">tools/create_listing_file.php</span>,
  by modifying parameters section such as
  <code>$conf['prefix_thumbnail']</code> or
  <code>$conf['use_exif']</code>.</li>

  <li>place file <span class="filename">tools/create_listing_file.php</span>
  modified on your distant website, in the same directory than your category
  directories (as the directory <span class="filename">galleries</span> of
  this website) by ftp. For the example, let's say that you can access <span
  class="filename">http://example.com/galleries/create_listing_file.php</span>.</li>

  <li>go to <span class="pwgScreen">administration panel, General, Remote
  sites</span>. Ask to create a new site, for example <span
  class="filename">http://example.com/galleries</span>.</li>

  <li>a new remote site is registered. You can perform 4 actions :

    <ol>

      <li><strong>generate listing</strong> : launches a distant request to
      generate a distant file listing</li>

      <li><strong>update</strong> : reads the distant <span
      class="filename">listing.xml</span> file and synchronizes with
      database informations.</li>

      <li><strong>clean</strong> : removes distant <span
      class="filename">listing.xml</span> file.</li>

      <li><strong>delete</strong> : deletes the site (and all related
      categories and elements) in the database.</li>

    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You can do all this by hand by generating yourself the <span
class="filename">listing.xml</span> file, moving it from your distant server
to you local PhpWebGallery root directory and opening the remote site
management screen : PhpWebGallery will propose you to use the found
listing.xml file.</p>
